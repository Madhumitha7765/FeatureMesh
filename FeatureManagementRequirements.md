## Feature Management in ML Feature Store

This feature enables users to perform essential operations on features stored within the ML feature store. Users can seamlessly edit existing features to modify their properties or values, view detailed information about features to gain insights into their characteristics, and delete features that are no longer needed or relevant for their machine learning tasks.

### Edit Feature:
- Users have the ability to modify properties and values of existing features.
- Editable properties may include the feature name, data type, description, transformation logic, and any other relevant metadata.
- Changes made to features should be reflected consistently across the feature store, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

### View Feature:
- Users can access comprehensive information about each feature stored in the feature store.
- Information provided may include the feature name, data type, description, creation date, last modified date, and usage statistics.
- Viewing features should be user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to filter, search, and sort features based on various criteria.

### Delete Feature:
- Users can delete features that are no longer required for their machine learning projects.
- Deleting a feature removes it from the feature store entirely, ensuring it is no longer accessible for model training or inference.
- Proper safeguards, such as confirmation prompts or access controls, should be implemented to prevent accidental deletion of critical features.
