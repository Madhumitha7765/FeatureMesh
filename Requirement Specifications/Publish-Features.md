# Narrative

As a Data Scientist working on a machine learning project, I need to publish newly engineered features onto the Feature Mesh platform. The goal is to streamline the feature engineering process, enhance productivity, and foster knowledge sharing among team members.

# Features

## Feature Publication

- Data Scientists can push their developed features onto the Feature Mesh platform.
- The system supports both GUI and library-based methods for feature publication.

## Metadata Specification

- Users can specify metadata for the features during the publishing process.
- Metadata includes information such as feature name, description, timestamp, and any other relevant details.

## Status Message Display

- The system provides real-time feedback on the status of the feature push operation.
- Data Scientists receive clear and concise messages indicating whether the feature publication was successful or encountered any issues.

# Feature: Publish Features

## Scenario: Data Scientist publishes a new feature

### Given
- The Data Scientist is logged into the Feature Mesh platform

### When
- A new feature is developed and ready for publication
- The Data Scientist initiates the feature publication process

### Then
- The system should prompt the user to provide metadata for the feature
- The user provides a feature name, keywords, and a timestamp

### When
- The Data Scientist chooses to publish the feature using the GUI or the library
- The publication process is initiated

### Then
- The system should display real-time status messages for the feature push operation

### When
- The feature publication is successful

### Then
- The system should confirm the addition of the feature to the Feature Mesh repository
- Provide a success message to the Data Scientist

## Scenario: Data Scientist encounters an issue during feature publication

### Given
- The Data Scientist is logged into the Feature Mesh platform
- A new feature is developed and ready for publication

### When
- The Data Scientist initiates the feature publication process
- Provides metadata for the feature
- The user encounters an issue during the publication process

### Then
- The system should display an appropriate error message

### When
- The error is resolved
- The Data Scientist retries the feature publication

### Then
- The system should successfully publish the feature
- Confirm the addition to the Feature Mesh repository
